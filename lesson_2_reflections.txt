What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
	Initializing the repository creates the .git folder and metadata for tracking file changes.
	You need to do it because otherwise Git won't work. The necessary data isn't there.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The working directory contains all of the files that you can work on.
	The repository also has a .git folder and the metadata for tracking changes.
	The staging area contains the files from the working directory to be saved as a commit.
	The staging area's value is that it allows you to select which files are saved as part of the commit.
	Otherwise a commit would contain everything in the repository which would group too many changes together.
