When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to work on the same project at work and at home.
  When I want to collaborate with coworkers or even the wider internet community.
  When I want a cloud-based backup of all of my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If I were doing experimental, unstable work, I wouldn't want my remote repository mangled by my changes.
	I could be starting a new project or version and not want to edit the remote version.
	I might not want other people's work messing with my version of the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
	Branches are within a repository and split off from the commit history to make changes while preserving the original code.
	Clones are copies of an entire repository and usually refer to local copies.
	Forks are clones made on GitHub to facilitate editing a repository while crediting the originator.

	Use branches when you're adding new features or otherwise changing a project.
	Use clones when you want a copy of an entire project for your own use.
	Use forks when you want a copy of someone else's project from GitHub.
